# Controllability-of-neural-fields-equations

The report is available in this file : https://github.com/MathieuRita/Controllability-of-neural-fields-equations/blob/master/Sander_Rita_Rapport.pdf

Repositories and files :

- Simulation_notebook.ipynb : a notebook that presents both the fiting of a gaussian function by its Fourier series and the simulations of the neural activity (neural fields equations) 
- calcul.py : a file that calculates the Kalman matrix and some parameters of the controlability theory
- simulation.py : baseline file in which we have prepared the Euler scheme in order to simulate the neural activity (with the neural-fields equations)
